## Objectives Weighting

Because not all objectives might be equally important, you can assign weights to each, to represent their preferences. Weights are assigned separately for each level of the objectives hierarchy. Any number can be entered in the input field. Once you click on "Apply", each weight sets will be normalize in order for the weight to sum to 1. If a negative number is entered for a given objective or attribute, its weight will be set at 0: the objectif or attribute will thereby not be considered in the analysis.

## How to assign the weights?

To assign the weights, you must:

1. In the Weighting tab, specify the weights for the attributes. The weights of the attributes of a given secondary objective are relative between them (?).
2. Specify the weights for the secondary objectives. The weights of the secondary objectives of a given primary objective are relative between them (?).
3. Specify the weights for the primary objectives.
4. Click "Apply".
