Currently SSANTO is able to process data if it is provided in four different forms. These are continuous data, categorical data, binary data and calculated data. Each of them will be processed differently by the software.

Their type is derived automatically from the column chosen for the shape file analysis. If the column contains text, SSANTO will consider it as categorical data and it will be necessary to define a value for each category in the value scaling step. If the column contains numbers, then the software will consider it as continuous data and will take its value during the analysis.

If no column is chosen, then the user will have chosen the None option in the column selection. A box will appear allowing the user to choose between Boolean and calculated data.

## Boolean

If Boolean processing is selected then the data will be treated as binary, i.e. all the area within the data set will be assigned the value of 1 and all the rest the value of 0. No value scaling will be done on this data and the only way to change its value will be via the weights.

## Continuous

The continuous values are very simple in their treatment, their numerical value is simply taken into account as their level of adequacy to the objective. If further processing is required, this is possible by defining a function during the value scaling phase.

## Categorical

Categorical values are special, because they have to go through the value scaling phase to have any importance in the analysis. Indeed, the data extractor will extract all the categorical fields in the first processing phase and it will be necessary to assign a score to each of them. By default the value of 0 is given to each one.

**⚠ ATTENTION, the assigned score will then be normalized between 1 and 0. So if several values are assigned, the final score of the worst category will always be 0 while that of the best will always be 1 regardless of their relative value. The other categories will be placed between these two extremes relative to their score.**

## Calculated

The calculated data allows to perform calculations on the data that could not be performed using the simple phase of value scaling because taking into account their relative position.
Currently there is only one type of calculated data, the distance data.

Two options for distance calculation are possible, with or without the use of a centroid. If a centroid is used, the centroid of the data ploygons is calculated and the distances are measured from this point. If a centroid is not used, the distance to the boundary of the provided polygon is calculated directly.

**⚠ ATTENTION The option without centroid requires much more calculation time and it is recommended to use it with low resolution analysis.**

the distance from this point is calculated up to a threshold distance given in parameter, from which an additional distance will have no effect.

By default, the value at the beginning of the calculation will be 0 and above the threshold limit will be 1. Of course it is possible to apply a value scaling function on these values afterwards if we want to minimize the distance instead of maximizing it or to perform any other operation of this kind.

Another parameter that can be controlled is the granularity. It allows to define the level of precision of the distance calculation. The higher the granularity, the more precise the calculation will be, but the longer it will take.The granularity represents the number of separations separating the continuous space into discrete value areas. The higher the granularity the more the area can be separated into multiple categories. A granularity of 1 is equivalent to separating the area around the centroid into two parts, one before and one after the threshold limit.
