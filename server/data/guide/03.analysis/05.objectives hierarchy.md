## What is an Objectives Hierarchy?

The Objectives Hierarchy will tell the system what are the various objectives, sub-objectives and attributes that will be used to perform the analysis.

For example, a complete Opportunities Objectives Hierarchy could look like this:

- Prioritise sites that offer the best opportunities for BMPs implementation
  - Optimising systems **performance**
    - Protecting systems from being contaminated
      - _Distance to landfill site or contaminated site \[0m - 8000m\]_
      - _Distance from a spent snow deposition site or a salt de-icing storage site \[m\]_
    - Prioritise soils with optimal characteristics
      - _Groundwater level \[1m - 60m\]_
      - _Hydraulic conductivity by soil type \[m/s\]_
    - Prioritise locations that have the right amount of rainfall
      - _Number of days per year with more than 1 mm of rain \[143-151 days/year\]_
  - Minimising systems implementation **costs**
    - Prioritise appropriate slopes
      - _Percent slope \[0% - >25%\]_
    - Prioritise integration with existing drainage infrastructure
      - _Distance to rainwater sewer infrastructure \[0m - 6000m\]_
    - Minimising the cost of land acquisition
      - _Minicipal property tax rates \[$/100$\]_
  - Maximising **ease of integration** in urban planning
    - Prioritise easy-to-acquire land
      - _Authority that manages the land \[categories\]_
      - _Level of opportunities offered by an easement site \[categories\]_
    - Prioritise appropriate lot size
      - _Size of land \[100m2 - 1800000m2\]_
    - Maximising integration into the road network
      - _Speed limit \[30 - 100km/h\]_
    - Maximising opportunities from planned projects and works
      - _Presence of planned (re)developments projects \[0 - 1\]_
      - _Presence of road renewal project \[categories\]_

## How to select an Objectives Hierarchy?

To select an Objectives Hierarchy, you must:

1. Open the [File Explorer](#file-explorer) tab
2. Upload the shapefiles containing the data you would like to use in your analysis. The files will be matched to categories later.
3. Open the Objective Hierarchy tab.
4. Depending on the NBS System selected at step 4, a default objectives hierarchy will be proposed.
5. Adjust the main objective, between Need or Opportunity.
6. Add primary objectives by clicking on the "+" button below the main objective.
7. Add secondary objectives by clicking on the "+" button below the primary objectives.
8. Depending on the NBS System selected at step 4, different primary and secondary objectives will by available.
9. Add attributes by clicking on the "+" button below the secondary objectives.
10. Add an attribute name, select a dataset, and select the data column.
11. Additional informations can be specified, based on the type of data in that column.
12. Click "Apply" to save the objectives hierarchy.

_Note: You may, at any time, delete the hierarchy in part of in whole by clicking the red "-" button showing when hovering over the attribute, secondary or primary objective._

## Additional options

Every column of a dataset can either contained continuous or categorical data. Every imported dataset also has an additional column named "[None]", which allows you to create a calculated attribute based on the geometry of the selected dataset.

### Calculated distance

When the field "Use calculated distance" is unchecked, the data input geometry is use as it is, with a suitability maximal inside the geometry, and minimal outside the geometry.
When checked, the field "Use calculated distance" create a continuous calculated attribute: data input is used to perform buffering calculations creating a distance raster map. You can specify the maximum distance used to create the buffer, in meters. Outside of this buffer, the suitability at the maximum distance is used.

_Exemple of a calculated distance of 2000 m_

_Exemple of a calculated distance of 10000 m_
![Image of a calculated distance of 60000](./distance_60000.jpg)
_Exemple of a calculated distance of 600000 m_

### Centroid

When checked, the buffer is created using the union of all points whose distance from the geometries's dataset centroid is less than the maximum distance specified by the user.

When unchecked, the buffer is created using the union of all points whose distance from the geometries's dataset instance is less than the maximum distance specified by the user.

![Image for centroid uncheck- multiple geometry](./centroid_false_multiple_.jpg)

### Granularity

This field allows you to specify the level of precision inside the buffer, used to compute the suitability. A granularity of 10 with the centroid option checked will create 10 concentric circles whose suitability is specify by the value scaling. A granularity of 1 will allow you to assign everything inside the buffer a unique value, creating a calculated boolean attribute. The greater the granularity, the more continuous the value scaling function application will appear.
