The value scaling is the tool allowing the final cleaning of the data. It allows to define an operation that will be applied on the data before the beginning of the analysis. There is a type of value scaling for each type of data except the Boolean data type which by definition can only take the values of 1 and 0.

Graphs illustrating the functions applied to the data are visible below the definition.

## Data type

### Continuous Data

Continuous data is represented by a continuous function. This function will be applied to each element of the data. It is defined as depending on a variable x which is the data we want to transform. By default the value scaling function used for this case is f(x) = x, which has the effect of not applying any transformation to the data.

More details on how to formulate the functions are provided in the section [Function definition](#function-definition).

### Categorical Data

Categorical data are represented by bar graphs. Each category is assigned a user-defined weight. During the analysis, all fields in these categories will be treated as having this numerical value. The given weights are relative to each other, and regardless of these after the normalization of the category, the maximum category will have a value of 1 and the minimum a value of 0. The intermediate values will be treated relative to these two extremes. By default, if no category weights are defined, they all have a value of 0.

## Missing Data

Sometimes, some fields may be missing from the data processed for some attributes. To analyze the missing cells anyway, the user can define the value of these cells himself. It is necessary that this value is proportional to the other data before Value Scaling and Normalization, because these operations will also be applied on this one.

## Normalization

The data normalization step allows all types of data to be treated in the same way regardless of their scale. It brings all the data values between 0 and 1. To do this the operation used is the following...

As we can see, after normalization, the maximum value of our data will be set to 1 while the minimum value will be set to 0. Any intermediate data will then be calculated according to this standard.

## Function definition

During the value scaling phase, it is possible to provide a function that will be applied to the studied data known as the variable x. This section is about how to formulate them and which symbol to use.
