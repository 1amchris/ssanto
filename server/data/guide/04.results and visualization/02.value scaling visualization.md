On the right side of the map, the "Value scales" box allows you to visualize the used value scales for the attributes of you objectives hierarchy. The visualization are updated once you click on "Apply" in the Value Scaling step.

## Continuous attributes value scaling visualization

For the continuous attributes, calculated or not, a linear graph allows you to visualize the function entered in earlier steps. The x-axis corresponds to the attribute's value and the y-axis corresponds to their suitability.

## Categorical attributes value scaling visualization

For the calculated attributes, a histogram allows you to visualize the suitability entered in earlier steps for each category.
