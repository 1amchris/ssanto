## What is the File Explorer?

The File Explorer will be used throughout the application. The File Explorer allows you to upload data so that you may use it at a later stage.

## How the File Explorer works?

To use the File Explorer, you must:

1. Select files from your computer using the "Choose files" button. Notice how you are able to see how many files you have selected once the dialog closes.
2. Click the button to upload them to the server.
3. You may now validate that the files have been uploaded to the server, as a list of uploaded files should appear underneath the "Choose files" button.
