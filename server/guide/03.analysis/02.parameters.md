## What are parameters?

Parameters are, as the name would suggest, parameters or settings that set the status of the analysis. The analysis depends on them, but they are common values, which will be used at later stages.

## List of parameters

Current application parameters (ordered alphabetically):

### Analysis name

The analysis name will be used to identify the analysis. When saving the work, you can name the analysis, so that it becomes easier to identify at a later stage: to load, to share the work, etc.

### Cell size

The cell size is comparable to the resolution of the analysis. Smaller cell sizes will take more time to render, but will be much higher definition than their higher counterparts.

### Modeler name

The modeler name will help identify who modeled the analysis for further references.
