## What is SSANTO?

SSANTO is a spatial suitability analysis tool, which uses the techniques of GIS-MCDA (Geo-information systems and multi-criteria decision analysis) following multi-attribute value theory (MAVT). It generates colour-coded, raster-based maps that indicate suitability for the implementation for a selected Nature-Based Solution (NBS)
